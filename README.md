# The Splunk Software Development Kit for C# 
### Version 2.0 pre-release

**Note: The Splunk SDK for C# is in-development and is not currently supported.**

The Splunk Software Development Kit (SDK) for C# contains library code and 
examples designed to enable developers to build applications using Splunk.

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search, and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a wide variety of 
other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze,
and generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the 
same technology used by the Splunk product to build exciting new applications
that are enabled by Splunk's unique capabilities.

## Supported platforms

.NET 4.5, Windows Phone 8.1, Xamarin IOS/Android.

## What's new in Version 2.0.

Version 2.0 introduces new modern APIs which leverage the latest .NET platform advancements. 

* Async/await - All APIs are 100% async
* Reactive Extensions - Splunk query results implement IObservable to be used with the RX framework.
* Support for multiple platforms - The new version is a Portable Class Library.

## Getting started with the Splunk SDK for C# 

The Splunk SDK for C# contains library code and examples that show how to 
programmatically interact with Splunk for a variety of scenarios including 
searching, saved searches, data inputs, and many more, along with building 
complete applications. 

The information in this Readme provides steps to get going quickly. In the 
future we plan to roll out more in-depth documentation.

### Building the SDK

Before starting to develop custom software, you must first build the SDK. Once 
you've downloaded and extracted—or cloned—the SDK, do the following:

1. At the root level of the **splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl** directory, open the 
**splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl.sln** file in Visual Studio.
2. On the **BUILD** menu, click **Build Solution**.

This will build the SDK, the examples, and the unit tests.

### Examples and unit tests

The Splunk SDK for C# includes full unit tests. Examples are a work in progress.
